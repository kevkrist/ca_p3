(1) LLB R1, 0x51 
            loads R1 with 0x??51
            Cache miss to bring in the next 8 instructions (32 cycles)
(2) LHB R1, 0x51
            loads R1 with 0x5151
(3) LLB R2, 0xB0
            loads R2 with 0x??B0
(4) LHB R2, 0xA0
            loads R2 with 0xA0B0
(5) ADD R3, R2, R1
            stores R2 + R1 --> R3, R3 = 0xF201
            RF bypassing should be happening
            EX-EX forwarding for R2 should be happening
(6) SUB R4, R1, R2
            stores R1 - R2 --> R4, R4 = 0x7FFF (saturation)
            MEM/EX forwarding to receive R2
(7) XOR R6, R3, R4
            stores R3 XOR R4 --> R6, R6 = 0x8DFE
            EX/EX forwarding to receive R4
            MEM/EX forwarding to receive R3
(8) SLL R7, R5, 6
            shift R5 left by 6 and store in R7, R7 = 0x0000
(9) SRA R8, R6, 2
            shift R6 right by 2 and store in R8, R8 = 0xE37F
            MEM/EX forwarding to receive R6
            Cache miss to bring in the next 8 instructions (32 cycles)
(10) ROR R9, R8, 10
            right rotate R8 by 10 and store in R9, R9 = 0x000
            EX/EX forwarding to receive R8
(11) HLT
            halt program

The expected trace is thus:
